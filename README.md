# Big_Data_Coursework

This repository contains drafts, and the completed verison, of an assignment for a course in Big Data management.
The assignment was to connect to a MongoDB database that contained collections of Sales documents and Product documents pertaining to soft drinks in vending machines.

The code queries the database to find the total amount sold of each drink, and generate replacement orders on a regular basis for the exact amount of drinks sold in a period, that would be sent to each provider.
